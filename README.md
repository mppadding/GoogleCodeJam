# Google Code Jam
This repository contains a few programs for the Google Code Jam of 2016
Qualification round.
Namely
* Counting Sheep
* Revenge of the Pancakes
* Coin Jam

# Reason
Reason of publishment, despite being unfinished is that I, Matthijs, believe
that the more code the internet contains, the more people are able to learn
coding.
